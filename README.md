# SudokuSolver
Various attempts at solving Sudoku's with different stochastic algorithms.

The Genetic Algorithm can successfully find the solution. Work needs to be done on optimizing this futher with changes to the selection, and mutation processes, as well as, population sizes. 

The simulated annealing algorithm is faster at finding the solution and simpler to code.
